This course is about CC2530, a MCU for Zigbee. There are some codes and  experiment.

#####  Title1:  GPIO Control LED

**Description**：We will  control LED by CC2530's GPIO (Generate Pin Input Output).

**Process   :**   

​        Frist, we should add "ioCC2530.h" to our project, the head file include many defines about CC2530.

​        Second, The mcu's system clock is 16M. We can define  a Delay function  accurately.

​        Third, The P1DIR control the GPIO's In or Out.  
<!--more-->
​        Now,we give the Delay function  

```
Delayms(uint x)
{
  uint i,j;
  for(i=0;i<x;i++)
    for(j=0;j<666;j++);
}

/*Note:  Fs= 16M 
         8051: 1/12
         for: 2 
  compute:16M/12/1000/2=666 */
```

 **Algorithm :**   If the LED has source, we can give GPIO Vol to light it.

​                        If  the LED has GND,  we can give GPIO Voh to light it.

 **Source code:**       

```
#include <ioCC2530.h>

#define LED P1_0;
#define KEY1 P0_5;

//Delay x ms
Delayms(uint x)
{
  uint i,j;
  for(i=0;i<x;i++)
    for(j=0;j<666;j++);
}

// main function 
void main()
{
  P1DIR|=0x01; //Set P10 Output
  LED1=0;  
  if(KEY1==0){
    LED1=1;
  }  else{LED1=0;}
}
```

##### Title2:  External interrupt Control LED

**Description**：We will  control LED by CC2530's Ext Interrupt and key .

**Process   :**       ​                              

 **Algorithm :** 

 **Source code:** 



##### Title3:  Timer interrupt Control LED

**Description**：We will  control LED by CC2530's Timer Interrupt and its frequent is 1HZ.

**Process   :**   

​        Frist, we should

​        Second,

​        Third,  

​        Now,

 **Algorithm :** 

 **Source code:**
